# Pi Wars
* Pi Wars is a robotics competition, in which teams must build and deploy a Raspberry Pi based robot to compete a series of challenges.
[piwars.org](https://piwars.org/)
* There are two days of competitions, with schools and other kids’ clubs competing on the first day, and general competition, divided into three categories (beginners, intermediates, and advanced/professionals) on the second day
* Challenges are staffed by volunteers, in shifts, each of whom recordsresults, which in turn get relayed back to a central collection point, and overall scores are calculated

## Problems
* Results get tallied incorrectly
* Results go missing!

## Solutions
* A web application to handle the management of results for Pi Wars Robotics competition

## Development Process
- Essentially an agile approach
  - Remember, customer involvement is critical
- Requirements:
  - Story cards
  - Mock ups
- Implementation:
  - Small, manageable chunks – you don’t have much time
  - Use your Kanban board
  - Use git
  - Use pair programming
  - Practice continuous integration – always have a working system on your demo server (once it has
  been set up)
- Testing
  - Unit testing
  - System testing

## Final Thoughts
* To provide experience in Team Software Project Management
* Develop commercial and industrial dimensions of Software Engineering
* Therefore this web application was specially designed in fulfillment of our Team Software Project (SSIT) module
